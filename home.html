    <h3>Ice Cream</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>How and When was Ice Cream found?</summary>
        <p>Ice cream has ancient origins, with early forms traced back to around 200 BCE in China, where mixtures of milk and rice were frozen using snow. In Persia (around 400 BCE), people made chilled desserts using rose water and vermicelli, kept cool with underground ice pits. During the 13th century, Marco Polo is said to have brought recipes resembling sorbet from his travels in Asia to Europe. Ice cream as we know it began to emerge in the 17th century, gaining popularity in Europe, especially in Italy and France. By the 18th century, it had spread to America, becoming a cherished dessert worldwide.</p>
